Used a reformed binary search to find the index of the pivot element and used another binary search to locate the index of the target element in the rotated array. Binary search is a perfect use for this question because it has a lower complexity than a linear search, and binary search met the requirements to answer the question given.

## Overall Time Complexity O(logn)
find_pivot_elem has a Time complexity of O(logn)
